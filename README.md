# DSA-Python-
This repository is made for DSA using Python. For this work i am using python 3.12 version.
<!-- First is Time Complexity and Space Complexity==>>>>> -->
Big o notation is used to measure  how running time or Space requirements for your program grow as input size grow.
time Complexity===>>

time=a*n+b
 i) keep fastest growing term
     time=a*n
 ii) Drop  constants
     time=O(n)

when time=a ,then
 i) keep fastest growing term
 ii) Drop  constants
 time=O(1)
when 
  time=an2+bn+c
  i) keep fastest growing term
 ii) Drop  constants
  time=O(n2)
